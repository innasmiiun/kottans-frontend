### <a name="fire">:fire:</a> 1. Git Basics - Notes
  I finished the course [Version Control with Git](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123) and completed levels at [learngitbranching.js.org](learngitbranching.js.org).
  This information helped me find out what is version control, how to initialize git, crea–µ a repositories, clone an existing repository, create new branches and change them. 
  I also learned how to add commits to the repository.
